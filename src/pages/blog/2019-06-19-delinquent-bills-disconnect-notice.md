Delinquent bills must be paid by Friday, November 22.  All bills not paid by this date are subject to disconnect on Monday, November 25.  Do not pay the bill online on Monday, November 25 because we do not receive those payments for 24 to 48 hours.  You can come to the office or pay over the phone.  The total bill plus a reconnect fee of $50 must be paid before water can be turned back on once it is turned off for non-payment.   (The reconnect fee for after hours is $75)  If your bill has already been paid please disregard this notice.
