Laurel county water district #2 will be doing our annual water main flushing beginning on October 30th around 8:00 am and will be continuing through the month of November.

Flushing operations may also lead to discolored water, which can be drawn into homes and businesses if the water is being used during or immediately following the flushing. Such events should affect customers for a few hours at most. If discoloration occurs, open the cold tap nearest the water meter to full flow until the water runs clear. In some situations, this may take 5 to 10 minutes. It is also advised that you make sure your water is clear before doing laundry or other projects for which discolored water could cause problems.

As a precaution, prior to using hot water run cold water tap for a few minutes to ensure discolored water is not drawn into the hot water tank.

If you have any questions please call our office at 606-878-2494
