description: 'Water Main Upgrade&Road Closure '
---
Construction will be taking place in Tom Town Hollow on 6/27/19.  The work will be to upgrade a section of our existing main to feed the south end of Tom Town. During the construction you will experience no water issues and road closures.  When water is restored Tom Town Hollow, Park Hill, E. Lewis Street, and Pace lane will be under a boil water advisory for 72 hours.  It is recommended that water is brought to a rolling boil for three (3) minutes before consuming.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
