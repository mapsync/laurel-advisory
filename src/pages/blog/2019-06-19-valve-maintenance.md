Required valve maintenance will continue today 6/20/2019 for the following areas; Hwy 830, Poplar Grove Church Road, Hwy 233, Buffalo Branch, Bryant Road, Dogwood Subdivision, Clover field Subdivision, Wildcat Trace, Sunshine Hill, and Fawn Valley Subdivision.  Low pressure may be experienced during this process.  We will be flushing all affected areas to properly clean our water mains.  We advise that the customer check to see if water is clear before doing laundry.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
