Required valve maintenance will continue today 6/24/2019 for the following areas; Buffalo Branch, Bryant Road, Clover field Subdivision, and Fawn Valley Subdivision.  Low pressure may be experienced during this process.  We will be flushing all affected areas to properly clean our water mains.  We advise that the customer check to see if water is clear before doing laundry.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
